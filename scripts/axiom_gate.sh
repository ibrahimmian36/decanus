# Erdős-647 publication gate.
#
# Two independent layers, both required:
#
#   1. Manifest (Erdos647/AxiomCheck.lean): every PUBLISHED theorem, listed by
#      name, `#print axioms`-ed for the record.
#   2. Audit (Erdos647/AxiomAudit.lean): every theorem in every Erdos647 module,
#      discovered mechanically from the compiled environment, so a theorem
#      added tomorrow cannot slip past the hand-maintained list.
#
# Every theorem must depend on AT MOST the three standard axioms
#   propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound
# (subsets are fine; several lemmas need less), with zero `sorryAx` and zero
# `_native.*` (native_decide is forbidden: it mints a per-theorem trust axiom).
#
# Usage: scripts/axiom_gate.sh          (from anywhere; exits 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL)
