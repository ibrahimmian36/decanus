/-! # Automated whole-library axiom audit

`AxiomCheck.lean` is the curated manifest: every published theorem, listed by
name and `#print axioms`-ed for the record. A hand-maintained list has one
failure mode: a theorem added later can be forgotten and never checked. This
file removes that failure mode mechanically. At elaboration time it walks
every module under `Erdos647.*`, finds every theorem (and any `axiom`
declaration, which would be worse), recomputes each axiom closure from the
compiled environment, and refuses to compile unless everything depends on at
most `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.

`sorry` (`sorryAx`) and `native_decide` (`Lean.ofReduceBool`,
`Lean.ofReduceNat`) lie outside that set, so either one fails this file by
construction. `scripts/axiom_gate.sh` requires BOTH the manifest and this
audit to pass, and CI runs the gate on every push.
